//! [`PlayerEntity`] — the audio playback subsystem as a standalone GPUI
//! entity, split out of [`TempoApp`] so that per-second playback ticks
//! and per-frame waveform shimmer animations only invalidate the player
//! bar instead of the entire app tree.
//!
//! ## Design overview
//!
//! `PlayerEntity` owns:
//! - the audio backend ([`PlaybackController`]) and its derived status
//!   labels,
//! - the currently-playing track *path* (not index — see "Identity"
//!   below),
//! - the volume slider state (including the in-flight drag),
//! - the output device picker state,
//! - the per-track waveform cache,
//! - the now-playing hover/alt-press affordances on the player bar.
//!
//! `TempoApp` retains everything that needs to *coordinate* across
//! regions:
//! - the `tracks` `Vec` and its index reverse-map,
//! - tab/queue state,
//! - "play this track" orchestration (which has to increment play
//!   counts, record history, and re-select rows in the active table —
//!   none of which `PlayerEntity` knows about),
//! - all keyboard action handlers,
//! - all modal/overlay state.
//!
//! ## Identity
//!
//! `PlayerEntity::playing_track_path` is a `PathBuf`, not a `usize`.
//! The previous monolithic design indexed into `tracks` with `usize`,
//! but every library reload reset the index to 0 (which was
//! incorrect — the user's currently-playing track moves in the list).
//! Keying by path means playback survives reloads, and cross-region
//! callers (table active-row highlight, history page) compare by
//! `track.path == player.playing_track_path()`.
//!
//! ## Communication
//!
//! - **Parent → Player**: direct method calls via `player.update(cx,
//!   |p, cx| p.start_playback(...))`.
//! - **Player → Parent**: typed [`PlayerEvent`]s emitted via
//!   `cx.emit(...)`. The parent subscribes once at construction. Events
//!   are deferred (flushed at the end of the current effect cycle) so
//!   the parent reacts on the next pass; this avoids re-entrant entity
//!   updates.
//! - For tab navigation (Now-Playing link clicks) and auto-advance
//!   (track finished → choose next via mode/queue), the player emits
//!   events and the parent does the work — `PlayerEntity` deliberately
//!   does not hold a `WeakEntity<TempoApp>` for these paths to keep the
//!   coupling one-directional. The only state `PlayerEntity` reaches
//!   *into* the parent for is the `tracks` table, and even that is
//!   indirected via events rather than direct upcalls.
//!
//! ## Why no `WeakEntity<TempoApp>` field
//!
//! An earlier draft of this module gave `PlayerEntity` a
//! `WeakEntity<TempoApp>` for "convenience". Resist the temptation:
//! - It introduces re-entrancy hazards (`app.update` inside a
//!   `player.update` will panic if both are leased).
//! - It makes it impossible to test `PlayerEntity` in isolation.
//! - Every legitimate need to talk to the parent is already expressible
//!   as an event.
//!
//! If something *seems* to need it, prefer adding a new
//! [`PlayerEvent`] variant.
